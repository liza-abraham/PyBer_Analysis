# PyBer_Analysis

##Overview

This project will leverage a PyBer data set in order to determine total fares each week, total rides each week, and total drivers each week, for a certain set of city types. 

##Method

In this project a new data frame is created in order to determine the average weekly fare from 1 Jan 2019 to 29 April 2019, for each of the city type. 

##Results

As one would expect, the dataframe confirms that: 

  - urban cities have the highest number of rides and drivers, while 
  - rural cities have the fewest. On the other hand, 
  - rural cities have the highest average far per ride. 

##Conclusion

The dataframe reflects expected saturation and pricing for rural vs urban markets. There are fewer drivers and less demand in rural markets, leading to more costly rides. The urban markets that host a larger saturation of riders and drivers see more rides but at more affordable prices.
